Slightly Longer Dad/Punny Tech Jokes (from shorter base):

1. programmer therapy? bugs in his life and infinite loop of bad commits
2. api dad joke: netflix password? 401 unauthorized, beg harder kid
3. git pr to dad: merge this? first resolve ex branch conflicts
4. docker cramped container: dad layers stack like family issues
5. k8s pod evicted: dad oof quota again, share cpu better eh

Balanced short-medium puns.
