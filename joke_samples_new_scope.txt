New Joke Samples (Punchier, Engaging, Tech/AI/Dev/FE/UX + Hub Vibes):

1. SV Tech Bro: demo day nerves: 3min to unicorn or ramen 💀
2. NY Fintech Hustle: series b paperwork thicker than code base 😭
3. Austin Bootstrap: sxsw swag bag heavier than revenue ☠️
4. Toronto AI Hub: grok vs gemini: polite canadian smackdown eh 💀
5. Frontend UX Hell: figma prototype: devs rebuild in css tears 😭

These are sharper (shorter punchlines), hub-specific (SV VC pressure, NY regs, Austin events, TO AI/polite), still cynical dev humor.
